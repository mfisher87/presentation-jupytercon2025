Let's talk about how hard it can be for data practitioners, whether that's
researchers, data scientists, data artists, or data engineers, to adapt to
working with their data in an programming paradigm using open source software
instead of proprietary software.

I think it's widely accepted that this is becoming a more and more necessary part of the job.
But it's still very hard.

And these are the kinds of problems geospatial data professionals using proprietary software enjoy.

It's really hard to read, but it says "Error 99999: Something unexpected caused the tool to fail. Contact technical support".
The message also helpfully suggests referring to the error help, as if that meaningless error is searchable.

So all the open source folks in the audience are probably thinking "we can do better".
And we can, and we have, with amazing projects like QGIS and Pangeo.

But also... this is the first web result I get when I search for "Python geospatial
visualization tools" on Google.

Imagine being told you _definitely_ need to learn 37 new tools to adapt to a
new way to do your job.

And as a software engineer, I see myself in this image, and I want to be better for my friends.

I'm Matt Fisher, and I'm a Research Software Engineer and Community Engagement
Manager.

I'm also a maintainer of several open source projects, and maybe we've interacted
on GitHub before!
I'll talk more about _JupyterGIS_ soon, but I also want to mention
_earthaccess_, one of my favorite community-owned projects I help maintain.
NASA data is behind a complicated API and authentication system, and
_earthaccess_ navigates those systems for you and helps you access the data in
3 lines of code.

I'm currently leading the GeoJupyter project at Schmidt Center for Data Science
and Environment at UC Berkeley.

Before that, I worked in building software for research support and data
analysis, visualization, management, and access at the National Snow and Ice Data
Center.

I also love dogs, gardening, and playing music on drums and keyboards :grin:

## :people_holding_hands: It's a communtity!

![GeoJupyter is **not** software; it's a **community** which will build many things together!](/assets/images/venn-diagram.svg)

:::notes
First and foremost, **GeoJupyter** is a community and a team effort with many players.

**JupyterGIS** is our flagship project, led by QuantStack;
JupyterGIS is a GIS platform in JupyterLab that can be used in similar ways to
QGIS, the leading open source GIS software, plus some cool new stuff.

We'll talk more about JupyterGIS shortly.

But our work is not limited to JupyterGIS.
Not everything we build is going to be a huge project or GIS-first.
It depends on what our community (that's you!) tells us they need.

# :brain: Jupyter is more than Notebooks

:::notes
To explain what we hope to contribute to this space that already has some
pretty great things going for it, let's pause and remember something important:

_Jupyter is more than Notebooks._

Jupyter is a modular and extensible architecture for interactive computing with
powerful, reusable building blocks.

For example, the `jupyter-collaboration` extension enables users to collaborate
on Notebooks in real time like Google Docs.
:::


---

![[JupyterCAD](https://github.com/jupytercad/JupyterCAD) by QuantStack](/assets/images/jupytercad.gif)

:::notes
The same `jupyter-collaboration` extension provides the foundation for a
collaborative computer aided design experience in JupyterCAD by QuantStack.

Here we can see 3 users collaborating on a part in 3 separate interfaces:
One in a Notebook widget, one in standard JupyterLab, and one in a custom
application user interface built specifically for JupyterCAD.

All 3 interfaces are made from the same building blocks.
:::



## :question: What is GeoJupyter?

:::elevator-pitch
<hr />

GeoJupyter is an open and community-owned effort to [reimagine geospatial
interactive computing experiences _within the Jupyter architecture_]{.jupyter-orange}
to enable more people to confidently engage with geospatial data.

<hr />
:::

:::notes
Back to "what is GeoJupyter":

Our mission statement describes us as an open and community-owned...

_Read the slide_

Maybe the first thing that jumps out is how broad this mission is, and
that's intentional.
We don't have all the solutions to this problem, but we know we can find them
by working with you.

What does it look like to **you** to **enable more people to confidently engage
with geospatial data**?

How can the Jupyter architecture help?

## Our values

:::evenly-spaced
:artist: **Human-centered**, participatory design

:open_hands: **Open source** and **open science**

:cartwheeling: **Approachability** and **playfulness**, like desktop GIS tools

:feather: **Flexibility** and **reproducibility**, like coding methods

:performing_arts: **Collaboration** and **storytelling**, like Jupyter Notebooks
:::

:::notes
These are the values that we feel will help us succeed at our mission:

We build and design in close partnership with users.

We believe in open source and open science, so everything we do is free and
open.

And it's important to us to create tools that unify the strengths of current
tools and workflows.

Desktop GIS tools offer **approachability** and **playfulness**.

Coding methods offer **flexibility** and **reproducibility**.

And the Jupyter ecosystem offers **collaboration** and **storytelling**.
:::


---

![You got your desktop GIS experience in my coding environment!](/assets/images/chocolate-peanut-butter.jpg)

:::notes
These values have historically been prioritized in separate tools and
techniques, but we believe they belong together!

But it's not going to happen by accident :smile:
It's going to happen because software engineers empathized and worked with
geospatial data practitioners.
:::


## :shrug: Why GeoJupyter?

```{python}
why_geojupyter()
```

:::notes
We are building this community because working with data about our planet is hard.

What we're bringing to the table is a holistic, human-centered, and
participatory approach to evaluating and improving this landscape.

So far we've conducted dozens of hours of user interviews to understand what folks need
most, and we'll continue to use the input of real people to guide our priorities.

Let's talk about a few examples of challenges we've heard from those
practitioners.

Many of these challenges have existing solutions, but they often involve either
proprietary software or cobbling together multiple tools, introducing workflow
friction.

:::notes
<!-- alex ignore fire -->
I imagine there are many people here whose live have been affected by fire, or
know someone who has.

<!-- alex ignore her-him he-she fires -->
Brianna, a former Deputy Manager at a NASA Data Center, lost her home in the
recent fires in LA.
When Brianna learned her home was at risk, her first thought, like a true
scientist, was to look at the data.
Recounting these events, she wrote:

> I should be able to do this. I have a PhD in Remote Sensing, I have built satellite data
> processing pipelines, I help manage one of the NASA satellite data centers, I teach
> courses on climate resilience, adaptation and geoinformatics. […] and yet the irony is

Many geospatial professionals feel locked in to certain tools when they want to
tell a rich story with spatial data.

## Rich storytelling for everyone {background-video="/assets/images/scrollytelling.mp4" background-video-loop="true" .video-bg}

:::notes
"Scrollytelling" is the cute name that I love for those beautiful and rich
storytelling experiences you've likely seen from large media organizations like
the New York Times.

These are done by expert programmers and visualization specialists.
For example, Mike Bostock, the creator of the D3 JavaScript data
visualization library, was behind many of the New York Times scrollytelling
experiences.

There's also the option of subscribing to proprietary services with
story-building tools.

Why not open source?
Imagine writing a MyST Markdown document that becomes a rich scrollytelling
experience like this.

for Quarto.

We're excited to partner with Andrew to develop a MyST implementation with
first-class support for geospatial scrollytelling.

## :shrug: Why GeoJupyter?

```{python}
why_geojupyter(2)
```

:::notes
Another challenge that we've heard widely reported by users is friction when
visualizing data about our planet from a programming environment, like a
Jupyter Notebook.

We've found many practitioners are perfectly comfortable writing code for
analysis, but visualizing data is an entirely different skill from analysis.
There's a wide variety of visualization libraries with unique and sometimes
frustrating interfaces.
It can be hard to choose, and each choice has a tradeoff.
Depending on the chosen library, practitioners may struggle to visualize many
datasets together, or to interact with the visualization in a meaningful way,
or to control the details of the visualization.

To get around this, practitioners described a process with many steps, like a dance.
We heard this so often that we gave it a name: "The GIS Bounce".

:::notes
To do the GIS bounce:

First, do some analysis.
Then, write out a data file to check your work so far.
If you're working in a cloud environment, download that data file.
"Bounce" over to QGIS, load up a basemap, and then finally load your data.
Now you can do your validation and "bounce" back to your notebook, and repeat!

That's a lot of steps, and they are repeated every time many practitioners
check their work -- a common and critical task.

Checking our work shouldn't be frustrating and time-consuming, it should be
seamless, joyful, and rewarding.

polygon data with a request to display it as a chorolpleth map.

We built something like this in JupyterGIS, and we're continuing to evolve the idea.

_Open in private window:_
<http://34.169.86.39:8888/>

**Matt Solo:**

* _Open `notebook.ipynb`_
  * First let's look at the basic GeoJSON extension's ability to view geospatial data in JupyterLab.
    There are lots of other ways to do this too.
  * _Run one cell at a time_
  * If we use JupyterGIS, we can programmatically start a new GIS project from
    its Python API, add a basemap, and add some GeoJSON data from a file.
  <!-- alex ignore just -->
  * We can view the project we just created in Notebook widget or in a new panel.

* Let's play with a premade GIS project.
  * _Open `france_hiking.jgis` from the examples dir_
  * This example JupyterGIS project file and many more are distributed with
    JupyterGIS, and you can check it out in your browser with JupyterLite from
    the "Try it now!" link in our README and docs.
  * This map shows hiking trails in France.
  * It's a bit noisy right now, so let's get rid of this MODIS layer.
	* _Hide MODIS layer_

* JupyterGIS comes with a layer browser that enables graphical selection from a collection of pre-curated layers
	* Let's add a layer that shows where Strava users are running
	* _Add a layer from the layer browser: `strava.run`_
  * The hiking layer is a bit hard to read now, though, so let's change the layer order.
	* _Move "Strava.Run" underneath "Waymarked"._
		* Still a bit hard to read, let's change the opacity.
	* _Set opacity of "Waymarked" to 1._
		* That's better!

* I was playing around with the San Diego public data portal and found a couple of interesting layers I want to explore.
	* _Add Unexploded_
  * You may notice that this interface looks similar to the JupyterLab file browser that normally shows up in the left panel, that’s because it is the same interface\! Remember Jupyter’s modular and reusable architecture!

	* _Identify a feature_
	* _Set up a “Scary” single symbol symbology_

* Let's look at an earthquakes dataset now
	* _Add eq.json_
	* _Identify a feature_
	* _Graduated symbology_
	* _Time slider_

* **Animate with “play button” (Fernando’s cue to go)**

**Fernando joins:**

* Fernando adds the “Points of interest” layer
* Matt notices the addition
* Zoom to layer
* Follow Fernando
* Fernando adds an annotation to the point of interest that looks good for lunch
* Matt responds “looks like a great spot!”
* Fernando Route layer to the map

:warning: **If something goes wrong** :warning:

* That's what I get for doing a live demo.
* I've flown too close to the sun, sorry for my hubris :laughing:
<!-- alex ignore just -->
* _Open browser debug tools_. **Hold on, I can fix this!!** Just kidding, let's move on :smile:

We want to work with you to make the ecosystem better, whether you're a
practitioner, developer, educator, communicator, or artist.

If you're wondering, "how can I be part of this awesome community", here are a few ways.
:::


## How you can join

{{< include how-you-can-join.md >}}

:::notes
If you can only do one thing, join us on the Jupyter Zulip, which is like an
open-source Slack.
You don't even need to register an account to view activity, but we would love
it if you joined in :smile:
So many cool people are there, I promise you'll fit right in ;)

In the short-term, we're going to be participating in the community sprints on
Thursday and I'd love to see you there!

There are lots of ways you can join our community and be a part of this mission.

We'd love to talk to you about your needs, frustrations, and opinions in an interview.

It would be amazing to see you at one of our bi-weekly hackathons or monthly community meetings!
You can view our community calendar on `geojupyter.org` or by following the link on this slide.

JupyterGIS is available for install with `pip`, `conda`, or equivalents.
If you follow the link on this slide or visit the documentation, you can find a link to try JupyterGIS with JupyterLite.
JupyterLite is a fully-browser-native version of JupyterGIS, meaning there's no server and nothing needs to be installed!
We're jazzed to hear what you think :smile:

<!-- alex ignore of-course special -->
Of course, we'd love to work with you directly on GeoJupyter projects, with
special interest in how you think Jupyter's modular and reusable architecture
can be applied to make geospatial data workflows more accessible and enjoyable.

We're excited to expand our **funded** development team, so if your company is
interested in sponsoring this work, please reach out.

If you have any questions, you can always reach out to me on Zulip, GitHub, or email.
